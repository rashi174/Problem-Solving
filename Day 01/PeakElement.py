'''Given an array A of N integers. The task is to find a peak element in A in O( log N ) .
An array element is peak if it is not smaller than its neighbours. For corner elements, consider only one neighbour.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
A[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 2 
Explanation: In the given array, 
3 is the peak element as it is 
greater than its neighbour.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
A[] = {3,4}
Output: 1
Explanation: 4 is the peak element 
as it is greater than its neighbour 
elements.
Your Task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. Just complete the provided function peakElement() and return a valid index with respect to 0 based indexing.
Note 1: Multiple peak element may be possible, in that case return any of the valid index .
Note 2: If you click on Compile and Test the output will be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[] <= 106'''
